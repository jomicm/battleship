### The logic used:
- There are always two boards. (However the number of boards could be overriden since every board, tile, and piece of render is a component).
- Each board will render a N number of tiles, the same number of rows an columns, having as variable row/col. The result board will always be a square one.
- Columns are represented with letters from A to Z and then using more letter if required lile 'AB'.
- Rows are represeted with numbers.
- There are 5 types of ships available: Carrier, Cruiser, Battleship, Destroyer and Submarine.
- Each player can put as many ships as wished of every type.
- Each player selects from a droplist the type of ship they want to place and the orientation; then clicks **Add selected ship!** buton and clicks in the initial coordinate to place the ship. If the resulting position of the ship results in tiles outside the board, it will try to correct to available coordinates when possible.
- There is also the possibility to let A.I. place our ships.
- There is also the possibility to select an A.I. as a player. (You can even select both players as AI, in that case they will start playing immediatly) 
- When you finish placing the ships you will have a list of your ships and the quantity of each one. This list will also notify when a ship is sunk.
- When a player is done placing ships, then clicks **I'm ready** button.
- When both players are ready and have pressed their respective buttons, then the game starts!
- Every Player has a turn (might be adjustable) then their boards turns into the enemy's one and they have to try to find enemy's ships.
- So they click on the tile the want to attack, a red color means HIT! and a blue color means MISS!. Once you sink a whole ship, the red attacked tiles will turn black.
- The game ends when a player has sunk all the enemy's ships.
